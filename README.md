# Minecraft-ML

I have a personal goal to build the perfect Minecraft bot with consumer grade hardware. Moonshot? Yes.:sweat_smile:  
This is my second attempt at building this bot, this time I am using my daughter for inspiration. As I watch her grow, she becomes proficient at one task at a time and has some sort of ensemble invoking all these functions and features together. Letâ€™s take the same approach, build one model at a time, and invoke the necessary features as we need them.  

Simple Models:
1. Jumping
2. Obstacle Avoidance  
3. Waypoint

## Jumping
The need to jump exists to navigate terrain. Train a simple model to hop over this pile of wood planks.
